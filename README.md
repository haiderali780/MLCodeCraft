# Machine Learning Projects

Welcome repository! This repository contains a collection of projects focused on implementing machine learning algorithms from scratch using Python. The primary goal is to enhance your understanding of machine learning fundamentals by building regression, gradient descent, k-means clustering, logistic regression, and other basic Python scripts.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this repository is to empower individuals with a deeper comprehension of machine learning algorithms. While libraries like scikit-learn provide powerful tools for machine learning tasks, implementing algorithms from scratch fosters a stronger grasp of the underlying principles. By coding these algorithms ourselves, we gain insights into their inner workings, enabling us to become more proficient machine learning practitioners.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Regression
- Implementation of linear regression from scratch.
- Polynomial regression for more complex relationships.
- Regularized regression techniques.

### 2. Gradient Descent
- Basic gradient descent algorithm implementation.
- Stochastic gradient descent and mini-batch gradient descent variations.

### 3. K-Means Clustering
- Unsupervised learning project focusing on K-Means clustering algorithm.
- Visualizations to understand clustering results.

### 4. Logistic Regression
- Binary classification using logistic regression.
- Extension to multi-class classification.

### 5. Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
- Building an OCR system to recognize text from images.
- Implementation of preprocessing techniques and machine learning models for character recognition.
  - Dependencies: Pillow, OpenCV, scikit-learn, NumPy

### 6. English to Urdu Translator
- Development of a translator using machine learning techniques.
- Utilization of natural language processing tools for translation between English and Urdu.
  - Dependencies: NLTK, scikit-learn, NumPy

### 7. Python Basics for Machine Learning
- Python scripts covering essential concepts for machine learning.
- Data preprocessing techniques.
- Evaluation metrics implementation.
